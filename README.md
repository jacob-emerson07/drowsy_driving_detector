# Drowsy Driving Detector

## Overview:
  This program utilizes OpenCV along with my own neural network to track a user's eyes and see whether or not they are open or closed. If they are closed for a certain amount of frames in a row, the program issues an alarm sound to grab the user's attention and their eyes to open as a result. The program also stores data about the trips about a user in a database, to which a user can access and see summary statistics about their driving (to be implemented in a future update).
  
## How to Use:
  After installing any dependencies you may need, run the **server_initialization.py** file to create the database with the relevant schemas added.
