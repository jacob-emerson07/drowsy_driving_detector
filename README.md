# Drowsy Driving Detector

## Overview:
  This program utilizes OpenCV along with my own neural network to track a user's eyes and see whether or not they are open or closed. If they are closed for a certain amount of frames in a row, the program issues an alarm sound to grab the user's attention and their eyes to open as a result.
